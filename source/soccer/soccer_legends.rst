**Pele (Edson Arantes do Nascimento)**
--------------------------------------
**Disclaimer**

		If you jumped to this page first, Fùtbol is what most of the world calls the sport, we Americans call Soccer.


	  	Pele is considered by many, especially his peers in the professional Fùtbol world to be the best player of the century. Reason for this, he was voted by a committee of peers as the best player of the century by an immense margin 63% ( `Wikipedia Player of the Century <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ FIFA_Player_of_the_Century>`_ ). He is a Brazilian Soccer Legend, who is known to those, who really know nothing about the sport he played. He has a record 3 world cup wins to his name, he has a couple world records `FIFA Pele World Cup Stats <http://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=63869>`_ `Pele 10 Compiled Statistics <http://www.pele-10.com/pele-statistics.html>`_ `Guinness World Record Stats <http://guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-career-goals-(football)>`_. My personal opinion he is the best to ever play, but I know I am no alone in thing this, just by the sheer margin of victory when voted best player of the century by his peers. That gives him the real credit to being a contender for greatest soccer player ever, as do his stats below, they truly back him up with a lot of legitimacy for the claim of greatest player. This man is why I wanted to be a pro Soccer player a little kid. Pele is great just look at the sheer number of goals he has to his name. He left a mark on the world of soccer that can't be understated. He played the game professionally for 21 years `Pele 10 Compiled Statistics <http://www.pele-10.com/pele-statistics.html>`_. When taking a look at the numbers it hard to deny the sheer incredible skill this man has, and what an inspiration he has been to 2 generations of Brazilian kids and kids around the world.

**Diego Maradona**
------------------	

Deigo Maradona an Argentinian Soccer Player Who was voted by Fans on FIFA.com as the player of the century, so he go the accolade along with Pele according to `Wikipedia Player of the Century <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ FIFA_Player_of_the_Century>`_. He is as according to his Official Site also considered one of the greatest of all time, if not the greatest `Diego Maradona Official Site <http://www.diegomaradonagroup.com/about-me>`_.  Now I there is now denying the impact he had on the field for Argentina during their world cup runs, but greats of all time I can't see it. Now, I think considering his impact on every team he was on, and his stats he generated, I would put him in the same soccer legend category, but not greatest ever as Pele. He has a World Cup when in 1986, and he got most Assists, Silver Shoe, and Golden Ball that year. He has many more accolades to his name. Considering his career spanned half that of the co-player of the century, he made a big splash for a shortened career. Not a ton of Pro soccer players can say, they have played for 4 world cups, or won a bunch of other top honors in 11 years no doubt. His stats speak for themselves and his fans spoke loud with his player of the century win, so he is hereby given soccer legend status `Diego Maradona Official Site <http://www.diegomaradonagroup.com/about-me>`_.

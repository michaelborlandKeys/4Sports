*Origins of Soccer*
===================

According the short concise origins of the game provided by FIFA, it’s actual origins are quested to this day. The modern version that 265 million players, and I around the world have come to love to play, was created back in 1863 in England.  What happened to create modern soccer was a split off of people playing rugby, and some started playing football instead giving birth to the first overseer of soccer in modern history. Now, that is the modern origin of soccer, and if you couldn’t tell by the sources FIFA is a huge overseer of soccer in today’s time. The soonest soccer like games were seen were in training books for the Chinese forces, in the BC era. The article goes on to explain in greater detail who specifically was responsible for creating the exercise Tsu’ Chu.  What they use, how similar it is to the basic principles of soccer use everything, but hands and head to move the ball. They talk later about another game from Japan that is kind of like a fundamentals exercise we do now, call juggling. Basically you get in a small circle, or large depending on team size and pass the ball around without the ball touching the ground. If it hits the ground the person who let it hit the ground is out, but that’s a new element added in modern times. Though, if the coach wanted to be mean he’d make the person run laps instead because it was a fundamental’s exercise for us. The final paragraph covered a game that has a similar layout as soccer, for field, but it was fundamentally different created by the Greeks. Basically, fancy passes, and “trickery” is how they put it is how the game was played. This is just a brief history of the origins of soccer, with the stats from the history of the world cup. I will cover the fundamentals of how to play soccer, and more statistics on 2 other pages listed below.

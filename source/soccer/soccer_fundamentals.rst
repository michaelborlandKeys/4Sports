**My Experience With Fundamental’s**
------------------------------------
I played Soccer competitively for 18 years, I quit my Freshman year of College to focus to solely on academics, Greek Life, and enjoying college. Now, my main position changed frequently throughout my career, I started out as one of the main 2 goalkeepers at age 5 when we started competing in AYSO soccer. I was recruited by the Assistant coach, who was a dad of another kid in the after school program. The rest is nearly ancient history in my eyes, that was so long ago. Now, even though we were five years old we were practicing like club soccer teen would, before regulations were passed. Our coaches ran us so much that we ran circles around the kids in our age group. Our focus on fundamentals were Dribbling, light kicking the ball down field until you pass, or shoot. Another was intense condition for as young as we were. We were being coached by a semi-pro soccer player and a National guard reservist, so practices were very disciplined from the start. We ran for the first 45 minutes’ Indian sprints, never figure out why they are called that. Basically, you jog in a line with one ball per person and the person in the back sprint up to the front then claps, and we did these 3 times around the school grounds as part of a warm up. We did on goal shooting drills, goal kick drills, and passing drills. We do a bunch more in a practice, but I want to keep the personal story shorter. I ended up moving in fourth grade from Goal Keeper, when the goals got way bigger to defense, and I was a floating defender left or right. I mainly for the rest of my career was a midfielder a forward. I was an assist machine from middle school on, I really didn’t score much throughout the many leagues I played in. There is also a special defender position that is used occasionally, my good friend Emily played it for nearly every team I was on, called sweeper. That is an incredibly brief summary of my soccer fundamentals experience, and an overview of positions. I will go into individual positions, and the fundamentals of those positions in the below section and subsections.

*The Basic Summarized Fundamentals of Soccer* 
---------------------------------------------
**Disclaimer I have to cover ball skills and, the manual only covered goal keeper as a position, so will stick to the fundamentals in the manual coverage, not position fundamentals.**

*Position: Goal Keeper*
The One position that can use their hands when with the goal box, which varies in size depending on what age group/ level of competitive play. They must follow all standard soccer rolls when out of the goal box, they will get called for a hand ball if they reach for it. Trust me it has happened in my career as a soccer player. Later in my career than you’d think it would happen.. 8th grade. My coach told me a fundamental’s that the  manual covers in incredible detail read more here . To summarize a small portion of the goal keeping section basically the diamond grip, w grip, and the different dives are the big starting fundamentals for basic saves, this allows for you to give the ball a target to hit to absorb the kicked ball. This fundamentals manual goes into incredible coaching detail, like specifics of how drills should be run to prefect these type of saves, including hand position of when you dive to corral the ball. It gives fundamentals on every section of body catching technique including above the head. These are all the fundamentals that keepers need to know with much more, but those are the basics. The Skills  School manual goes into incredible detail, so just saying what fundamentals need to be covered is all I can cover in a short article.

**Global Soccer Statistics**
============================
The global statistics on soccer gather by FIFA are pretty insane, I knew it was the most popular sport in the world. I was surprised to find out over a quarter of a billion people play it competitively for organizations around the world. I know if the surveyed people who don’t play for an official origination it would be much greater. It is just as surprising to me that the US beat out all countries for total of soccer player out of everyone, it surprises me that a lot of those countries don’t have much higher than US numbers. I think I has to do with freedom/ economic ability to join soccer organization as a youth, because we clearly have number 1 in the youth category. Now in the registered category it is a much less surprising, except US at number two, I know soccer has gain popularity it recent years, but I didn’t think we would be second in the world beating out India, considering population difference. I did already cover the economic angle, but it could also be a factor to why overall we have more registered than India. Plus, Cricket is more popular than soccer there, but I figured it was possible with population density they would have more registered soccer players in the world than us. Statistics about the amount soccer has grown as a sport is fascinating. The article explains that through this study that the game of soccer has skyrocketed in popularity, and the Governing body FIFA takes credit for the increase and offer some really detailed insight about the statistics. check out the article linked below. The tables are copied from the article.

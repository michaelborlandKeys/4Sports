**My Experience With Fundamental’s**
------------------------------------
I played Soccer competitively for 18 years, I quit my Freshman year of College to focus to solely on academics, Greek Life, and enjoying college. Now, my main position changed frequently throughout my career, I started out as one of the main 2 goalkeepers at age 5 when we started competing in AYSO soccer. I was recruited by the Assistant coach, who was a dad of another kid in the after school program. The rest is nearly ancient history in my eyes, that was so long ago. Now, even though we were five years old we were practicing like club soccer teen would, before regulations were passed. Our coaches ran us so much that we ran circles around the kids in our age group. Our focus on fundamentals were Dribbling, light kicking the ball down field until you pass, or shoot. Another was intense condition for as young as we were. We were being coached by a semi-pro soccer player and a National guard reservist, so practices were very disciplined from the start. We ran for the first 45 minutes’ Indian sprints, never figure out why they are called that. Basically, you jog in a line with one ball per person and the person in the back sprint up to the front then claps, and we did these 3 times around the school grounds as part of a warm up. We did on goal shooting drills, goal kick drills, and passing drills. We do a bunch more in a practice, but I want to keep the personal story shorter. I ended up moving in fourth grade from Goal Keeper, when the goals got way bigger to defense, and I was a floating defender left or right. I mainly for the rest of my career was a midfielder a forward. I was an assist machine from middle school on, I really didn’t score much throughout the many leagues I played in. There is also a special defender position that is used occasionally, my good friend Emily played it for nearly every team I was on, called sweeper. That is an incredibly brief summary of my soccer fundamentals experience, and an overview of positions. I will go into individual positions, and the fundamentals of those positions in the below section and subsections.

*The Basic Summarized Fundamentals of Soccer* 
---------------------------------------------
**Disclaimer I have to cover ball skills and, the manual only covered goal keeper as a position, so will stick to the fundamentals in the manual coverage, not position fundamentals.**

*Position: Goal Keeper*

The One position that can use their hands when with the goal box, which varies in size depending on what age group/ level of competitive play. They must follow all standard soccer rolls when out of the goal box, they will get called for a hand ball if they reach for it. Trust me it has happened in my career as a soccer player. Later in my career than you’d think it would happen.. 8th grade. My coach told me a fundamental’s that the  manual covers in incredible detail read more here . To summarize a small portion of the goal keeping section basically the diamond grip, w grip, and the different dives are the big starting fundamentals for basic saves, this allows for you to give the ball a target to hit to absorb the kicked ball. This fundamentals manual goes into incredible coaching detail, like specifics of how drills should be run to prefect these type of saves, including hand position of when you dive to corral the ball. It gives fundamentals on every section of body catching technique including above the head. These are all the fundamentals that keepers need to know with much more, but those are the basics. The Skills School manual goes into incredible detail, so just saying what fundamentals need to be covered is all I can cover in a short article.

*Balance Fundamental’s*

The reason these fundamentals are needed are for being able to stay on your feet, and be able to do all drills successfully. Some of them are for strength like lunges, sit ups, push-ups, and stretches are to reduce injury some of those are trunk twists, try and touch your toes standing and sitting. My coaches favorite because it involved running and balance, what we called Hills. Basically, running as fast as possible up a very steep short incline 10-20 times 3 times a practice. Sometimes he would make us race for rewards, mainly ending practice 10 minutes early.  More detail on the other exercises in the `Soccer Fundamentals Manual <http://www.usyouthsoccer.org/assets/1/1/Skills_School_Manual.pdf>`_.

*Dribbling Fundamental’s*
 
I think they are mixing up two different Dribbling techniques, because one is when your dribbling down field to score, and another is dribbling to get away from an opposing player. Basically, the first technique they are teaching is one for scoring, no special name for it. Reason I believe it is the first one is, because that is the one where you kick it many yards ahead of you, to move quickly. The other one you want to keep it closer to you, and then pass as soon as there is opening because the opposing play is right there, you need a target before kicking it many yards.  More detail on dribbling found in the `Soccer Fundamentals Manual <http://www.usyouthsoccer.org/assets/1/1/Skills_School_Manual.pdf>`_. 

*Finally Ending with Passing Fundamental’s* 

Too much detail to cover techniques, because there are so many, all detail found in the `Soccer Fundamentals Manual <http://www.usyouthsoccer.org/assets/1/1/Skills_School_Manual.pdf>`_. The Big 5 ground passing techniques Inside of foot bent pass most used for med to short longer ranged passes, outside of foot bent pass most used for short ranged passes. Crossing the most important pass for getting in scoring position, it is difficult because a lot of them get intercepted by the opposing team. Hard to get really good at, but it is very possible with practice.  Inside of foot med height pass is my bread and butter, it is good for learning how to curve the ball for distance, and shots on goal. Toe poke is an important if there a bunch of people around and close together, it good for short distance. Pros can make it long distance, but I’ve only ever used it for short distance passing. Those are just a few of the passing techniques in soccer, as stated many times before, you can find greater detail in the `Soccer Fundamentals Manual <http://www.usyouthsoccer.org/assets/1/1/Skills_School_Manual.pdf>`_.
